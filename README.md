🎮 Global Video Games: Regional Sales & Critic Trends
This project is an interactive Executive Dashboard designed to analyze the global gaming landscape, focusing on regional sales performance, platform popularity, and the correlation between critic scores and market success.

📂 Data Source Information

Dataset: https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground/video-game-sales/VG_Chartz24 (Video Game Sales & Ratings).

Volume: Comprehensive transactional records covering games from 1980 to 2015+.

Scope: Global data including Region (NA, EU, JP, Others), Genre, Console/Platform, and Critic Scores.

🎯 Project Overview
This dashboard was developed to answer key industry questions:

Regional Dominance: Which regions contribute the most to a game's total revenue?.

Market Trends: How have sales evolved over the decades across different genres?.

Quality vs. Sales: Does a high Metascore (Critic Score) always translate to higher sales figures?.

💡 Key Business Insights

Regional Insights: Identified North America (America Sales) as a primary revenue driver for top-tier titles like Grand Theft Auto V.

Genre Popularity: Visualized how "Action" and "Shooter" genres dominate the modern console eras (PS4, XOne).

Historical Peaks: Detected the 2010s as a peak decade for software sales before the shift in market dynamics.

🛠️ Technical Process (The Workflow)

Data Preparation & ETL: * Cleaned and structured the VG_Chartz24 table to ensure consistency in regional naming.

Validated sales figures (e.g., NA Sales vs. Global Total) using Power Query.

Data Analysis Expressions (DAX):

Developed measures for Total Sales, Regional Totals, and Average Metascore.

Created a Decade grouping for better long-term trend analysis.

Effective Visualization & UI/UX:

Interactivity: Configured Edit Interactions to allow Cards to filter the entire dashboard.

Advanced Navigation: Implemented a Pop-out Slicer Menu using Bookmarks and Selection Pane to maintain a clean, "Puno Na" yet organized layout.

Hierarchy Slicers: Combined Decade, Genre, and Console into a single drill-down slicer for deep-dive analysis.

🎨 Design & Branding

Color Palette: Professional Slate Gray and White theme with high-contrast accents for Metascores.

Finesse: Optimized visual layering (Bring to Front/Back) to ensure interaction icons are accessible without cluttering the UI.
